# UI Level Design Course implemented on C++
[Unreal 5.3] UI Level Design Course

This project is the reimplementation of this [Unreal's official course:](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/5L3/unreal-engine-implementing-ui-for-level-design/LEWY/unreal-engine-implementing-ui-for-level-design-overview)

The goal of this project was to train and learn how to implement different aspects of game logic, conditions, UI, and more into C++. Although, some Blueprints logic was implemented as well, this was keep as low as possible. Not all the course was implemented here, just the first part in order to get the core elements implemented.
